Reflect on Your Design
----------------------

What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

The most important change in my model is the inclusion of ndb.StructuredProperty
to save a deck of cards and history. I chose this option because it allow me to
save an array of objects which help me to resolve the game logic.

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new
game logic?

Add a StructuredProperty had an important level of difficult bacause I didn't know how
to interact those values.

Other problem was related to the design of database. For example,  when is better to use a relationship
between kinds or when you should include one kind as property of the other kind.
